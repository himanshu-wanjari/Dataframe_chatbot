This project enables users to ask **natural language questions** about tabular data (Pandas DataFrames) and get meaningful answers. Powered by **LLMs** and **Python**, the tool transforms user queries into executable code and provides responses based on the dataset.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Ask data-related questions in plain English
- 🤖 Translates questions into Python/Pandas code using LLMs
- 📊 Supports CSV, Excel, and DataFrame input formats
- 🧠 Built with OpenAI API or local language models

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- OpenAI / Hugging Face Transformers
- LangChain (optional for chaining tasks)
- Streamlit (optional UI)
- Jupyter Notebooks
